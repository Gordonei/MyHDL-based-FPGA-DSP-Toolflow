Project Description
===================
Watch this space!
	*

Guide to Project Contents
=========================
1) Supporting - directory for utilities used to create/look at the data that might be created by the toolflow
  1.1) DFT_Arithmetic_Model - a simple arithmetic model for performing a Discrete Furiour Transform

2) Tooflow Code - directory for the toolflow code, including the base Actor and Arc classes and its dynesty, as well as the module development testbenchs.
  2.1) Old HDFT Code - first iteration of the code, used to implement my flexible-radix FFT algorithm which takes advantage of FPGA multipliers.

Dependencies
============
1) Python
2) MyHDL (www.myhdl.org)
3) Numpy
4) Matplotlib
	*

Getting Started
===============
Still getting going, so haven't made a proper egg and install script, etc. 

That being said, its pretty straight-forward to use:
1) Make sure you have the dependencies installed
2) Copy the code in the Toolflow Code directory into the directory in which you intend to create your DSP system.
3) Import the various libraries as needed in your code.
